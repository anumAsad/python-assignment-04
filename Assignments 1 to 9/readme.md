# Python Projects

## Project 1: Mad Libs Python Project
This project involves creating a fun word game where users provide random words to fill in the blanks of a pre-written story. This helps beginners practice string concatenation and user input in Python.

## Project 2: Guess the Number Game (Computer)
A simple game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. The program provides hints (higher/lower) to guide the user. This project helps practice conditionals and loops in Python.

## Project 3: Guess the Number Game (User)
In this variation, the user picks a number, and the computer tries to guess it using binary search logic. The user provides feedback (higher/lower) until the computer finds the correct number.

## Project 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors Python Project
A classic game where the user plays against the computer. The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on the game's rules.

## Project 5: Hangman Python Project
A word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by guessing letters. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Project 6: Countdown Timer Python Project
A simple countdown timer that allows users to enter a time duration and counts down to zero. This project helps beginners work with loops and the `time` module in Python.

## Project 7: Password Generator Python Project
A tool that generates strong passwords based on user-defined criteria (length, special characters, numbers). This project gives practice with loops, string manipulation, and the `random` module.

## Project 8: Create a Python Streamlit BMI Calculator Web App
A web-based BMI calculator built using Streamlit. Users enter their weight and height, and the app calculates their BMI, categorizing them into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## Project 9: Build a Python Website in 15 Minutes With Streamlit
A simple web application created with Streamlit, demonstrating the basics of building interactive Python-powered websites. Users can input data, interact with buttons, and view dynamically updated content.
